        <h1>About our planets</h1>
        <p>The solar system is a gravitationally bound system which orbits around the sun. We have a total of eight planets that orbit the sun, with Mercury being the closest planet to the sun and Neptune being the furthest away from the sun. We used to have a total of nine planets in our solar system back in the beginning of the 1990s with Pluto added onto it. However, pluto was such a small “planet” that it was questioned for some period of time and eventually ruled out and changed from a planet to a dwarf planet instead</p>

        <p>The vast majority of the system’s mass lies within our star, known as the Sun, with the rest of the remaining mass mostly contained in Jupiter. Our 4 inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are called “terrestrial planets” because they contain rock and metal and tend to have a solid planetary surface so you can land a spaceship onto it and walk on the planet. On the other hand, the four outer planets we have in our system, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are called giant planets because well, they’re obviously massive in size. These 4 planets are substantially more massive than the inner planets. The one downside is that the largest planets being Jupiter and Saturn are massive gas planets, mainly composed of hydrogen and helium, the other 2 planets Uranus and Neptune are massive ice planets, containing mostly substances that have high melting points such as water.</p>

            <h2>What we know</h2>
            <p>As far as we know today, the solar system was created about an estimated 4.6 billion years ago. Every single planet in the solar system has its own specific path that it takes in order to be able to orbit around the sun, thus creating the solar system in this case. The Sun is the center of the entire system and if we did not have our star, everything will collapse and we'll die on Earth. However, it takes a long time for a planet to even orbit around the sun one singular time. For example, Earth takes around 24 hours to move around the sun, the further away the planet is from the sun, the longer it’ll take for it to move around the sun once. For some planets it could take several years for it to orbit the sun a singular time, take Neptune for example where it will complete 1 rotation of its path around the sun every 165 years.</p>

            <p>Our solar system lies within the Milky Way, which is basically a massive galaxy that contains all of us. It got its name because of its resemblance when you look into the sky from Earth. Furthermore it's also said that our galaxy contains even more than just one solar system, there could be many other solar systems that we haven’t even discovered yet and that we’re not the only ones in the galaxy. Furthermore there is also the existence of the black holes which is an extremely dark hole in space where gravity is so strong that literally nothing, not even a slight bit of light can escape from it. We definitely do not want to be near any of those black holes.</p>
